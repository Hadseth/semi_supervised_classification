# A Cross-validation framework for semi-supervised classificiation methods on graph nodes

A Cross-validation framework for several semi-supervised classification methods on graph nodes with Julia. It is possible to combine various Graph Similarities, Kernels and methods in order to classify nodes from graph data. Cross-validation is performed on a grid search with several parameters, depending on the method.

Most of the methods were used (and explained) in :
